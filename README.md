## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm install

npm run dev
```

Use [http://localhost:3000/user/dashboard](http://localhost:3000/user/dashboard) to access authenticated page or use the Home button in the drop down menu after authentication

May need to refresh on first load if using

```bash
npm run dev
```

If routing isn't working properly check cookies

Inspect->Application->Clear all the cookies
