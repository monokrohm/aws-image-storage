## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm install

npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Use [http://localhost:3000/user/dashboard](http://localhost:3000/user/dashboard) to access authenticated page or use the Home button in the drop down menu

If routing isn't working properly check cookies

Inspect->Application->Clear all the cookies

Also there seems to be latency verifying logged in/out status
